        <h1>My Raspberry Pi 4B Setup</h1>
        <section>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Everyone who works with computers should have a raspberry pi for
            multiple reasons. One of which is most important to myself is the
            fact they are ARM64 based cpu architecture. Not to mention these
            days they come out with 8GB of ram, which quite honestly is more
            than enough. I'm not trying to market for raspberry pi here, I
            genuinely love the fact I can buy a cheap computer with zero
            pre-installed firmware. Ok scratch that apprently it does have
            some form of proprietory firmware in the integrated gpu within the
            processor, but from what I hear its very tame and nothing like the
            intel management engine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, having a lot of ram, a strong GPU, and strong CPU are
            all really nice conveniences. However this has allowed a lot of
            software developers in todays world to rely on such
            conveniences... This has brought about a great shame. It doesn't
            have to be a Pi, owning a "limited" computer by todays standards,
            working with it, will make you a better computer operator.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>Basic Setup</h2>
          <h4>Hardware</h4>
          <p>
            In regards to hardware, Its mostly all just what you would find in
            the basic Canna kit for a raspberry Pi4B model. The "Upgrades",
            I've done in this area would be a better aluminum cooling case,
            and an external SSD drive using one of the 3.0 USB ports.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do have a UPS (Uninterupted Power Supply) integrated, however
            there is a lot that can be done via the software to make this a
            much nicer setup, and hence will be briefly mentioned here.
          </p>
          <h4>Firmware</h4>
          <p>
            As a quick recap in case you don't know, firmware is essentially
            what sits between your motherboard (hardware), and your operating
            system (software). Which makes itself the first software that will
            be ran after you turn on your machine via the power button. For
            the Pi, at this point of the process, I just have a simple Debian
            Distribution of sorts that was found via the official raspberry pi
            repo. Maybe I could "efficient max" here and put in a gentoo
            version, or even just de-bloat maybe what I think is bloat. But at
            a certain point, I'm just happy to have something non-proprietory
            as my firmware which sadly is very un-common today.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>OS</h4>
          <p>
            So this is the part where it starts to become fun, I must
            emphasize my configuration isn't the gentoo-on-rpi-64bit by
            Sakaki, nor the community forked version. <br />Initially these
            options were interesting to me, however their last updates were
            years ago and some of the configurations arn't as I'd like them
            myself. In such situations, its typically easier to just set this
            up yourself, and there is good enough documentation on the gentoo
            wiki for this.
          </p>
          <p>
            So if it isn't obvioius, the OS I've chosen for this machine is
            Gentoo. Paired with the earlier mentioned SSD and cooling case,
            the fact I compile everything from source is not a problem at all.
            I've migrated all the read write process onto the SSD, with the SD
            handling the initial boot up process which drastically reduces the
            wear and tear on the SD. At the moment of writing this, I have not
            written my reason for using Gentoo and loving Gentoo. If you've
            read up until this point, and have a basic understanding of
            Gentoo, not much needs to be said at this point in time.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Systems</h4>
          <p>
            So finally the part that starts to make this setup be useful.
            Whats nice about gentoo is that I only have what I use. This means
            that for example, because I don't need a desktop environment I
            simply do not have one installed. I do however have Tmux, and Nvim
            installed. You could argue that this is unncessary because TTY is
            around, and nano exist, although I think I may have had to install
            nano funnily enough. Regardless, these are my conveniences and
            sometimes its nice to have nice things okay, jeez. Nvim in
            particular is nice because thats my current editor I've been using
            and learning. Eventually I'd love to learn ARM64 here, and Neo-Vim
            will make that a very enjoyable experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a NAS (Network-Attached-Storage) via the samba software
            which uses the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol. This is quite
            honestly very convenient, as I hold my music database here which I
            can then access on other machines connected to my network and play
            them via MPD. However here is a more real world scenario I've had
            happen every day I have a java class. I would be working on my
            main PC, and simply needing to transfer my Java homework, I just
            drag and drop the folder from one computer, the pi, and then
            finally on my laptop I drag and drop onto my local storage
            somewhere, ALL THROUGH A UI FILESYSTEM INTERFACE. So yeah super
            convenient, and it all takes me like I don't know twenty seconds
            or so. Genuinely a really nice convenience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mentioned it earlier, but I have a UPS system setup, the
            software that enhances the dumb battery and makes it smart is the
            very funnily named NUT system. The guide on the official gentoo
            wiki is honestly perfect and that's what I used. This is really
            nice to have because say power goes out, my Pi might be compiling
            something important or there may be un-saved buffers. Really not
            the best thing to have happen to memory. With NUT, I'm able to
            configure it to safely self shut-down itself if it detects power
            has been out for say five minuets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quite honestly, there is a lot more I could do here, and it
            wouldn't be so difficult to setup... However I'm in school, and
            can only afford to setup one of these systems a weekend or so.
            Rome wasn't built in one day. At the moment when I need to update
            my Pi I do this manually, however there is a Daemon (system) that
            I plan to configure known as Cron. This essentially is an
            automatic-updater, where I can also have it email me once it does
            its job of all changes/complaints on what's going on. Paired with
            the fact this is all in Gentoo, I could litterally have the long
            compile process going on say when I'm away from the computer. If
            anything goes wrong, well NUT is there to save the day with a safe
            shutdown procedure in case power goes out. The point is, that
            having a setup like this, you can come up with lots of daily
            conveniences that just makes your daily work flow more pleasant.
