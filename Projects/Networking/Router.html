            Setting up a BSD router probably from a pfSense configuration.
          </h1>
          <p>
            Lately Networking has been my current interest. That unfortunately
            means I've kind of sacrificed my time for various other projects
            such as game development. With that in mind, as cool as it would
            be to setup my own BSD configuration from the groundup. Honestly
            pfSense is a really great solution maintained and lead by people
            who are dedicated to this field. So I am most likely going to just
            use pfSense as my OS of choice for my router. I'm sure there are
            many resources and guides on how to do this process and it really
            doesn't seem so difficult, but I'll be going through the process
            so why not showcase my work as I do it here, I'll be doing it
            anyways.
          </p>

            Configuring a custom router is not only a really great learning
            experience, but actually a huge security boost. Your basic router
            that you recieve from your ISP isn't actually that good in regards
            to say its basic firewall security. BSD from what I understand is
            the recommended "Server" operating system for usecases such as a
            router. For example, you could setup your own VPN and be able to
            connect to your home internet from anywhere in the outside world.
