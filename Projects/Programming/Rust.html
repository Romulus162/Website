            <h1>Rust performance and memory safety!</h1>
            <p>
              Rust is a very nice language to work with, partly because it holds
              your hand with its really well made compiler. It is designed to be
              memory safe with its borrow checker system.

            <h2>My Solutions for the Advent of Code!</h2>
            <p>
              So Advent of code has started, and I have my first days solution
              below, but as I've just now realized this page will become very
              messy very quickly. I doubt anyone is really checking out my
              website on a daily basis, but in the offchance anyone is here
              during the messy phase of my Advent of code event. This will be a
              pretty good opportunity to refine my overall website flow. I will
              probably be spending my next efforts on this page these next
              couple of weeks and that will just translate to the rest of the
              website more or less.
            </p>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
              So I have a Java test for my school basically three days after
              Advent of code concludes. This means this fun little event can
              turn into a liability. So, with that in mind, I am actually
              un-appologetically using A.I. to just turn off my brain and just
              come up with a "solution". This is because if I spend the effort
              to genuinely make a proper solution the proper way, I run the risk
              of thinking about Rust code during my Java test. That doesn't mean
              I'm just fully copy and pasting though, it just means I write out
              what makes sense, and I quickly fall back on AI, because I want to
              still participate in this event, but I don't want it to get in the
              way of my Java test. In the same idea, I could be doing this in
              Java, however the context is "simple" java, so I can't use any
              external libraries we havn't learned about yet, and we haven't
              learned many libaries other than some default ones in my class
              yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              COPE: This isn't actually a bad strategy, its a good mix up in my
              daily routine. Additionally in the future I intend to just make
              some YT videos explaining the solution, and I will also be
              re-writing/making a lot of this website in Polish anyways. So I
              will be returning to these "solutions", and perhaps maybe even
              making them better. Although this would be later, past the
              conclusion of the advent of code event happening this year of
              2025.

            <h2>Day 1</h2>
            <p>
              Yeah so my html formatter is making it appear goofy, and of course
              I should apply some css or something to make this more appealing.
              If you are present during these early stages, you may find it
              easier to just checkout the code on my github, I linked it in the
              related part of this page.
