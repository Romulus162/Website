        <h1>Mint OS, a basic overview.</h1>
        <section>
          <h2>Why even bother?</h2>
          <p>
            In today's world, when you say, pick a random desktop computer
            typically you'll find that is operating with Windows. Despite
            Windows being a popular desktop OS, it has greatly deviated from
            the standard. Just because something is popular, doesn't make it
            the correct method nor the standard.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, there is actually a greater ecosystem in linux, and your
            actually exposing yourself to what you never knew existed. There
            are many technologies which simply aren't available on windows or
            because of their own proprietory nature. In the beginning, you
            might have fear or doubt of losing or missing out on what you've
            known. Say the microsoft office applications, some popular game
            engine, or anything else I might not be considering such as just
            simple games running. There are alternatives, software that does
            the same and in my opinion better, but of course everything is a
            learning curve at first and this can be intimidating.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm going to say something a little radical, and quite honestly
            blunt.
            <b>If it's not easily compatible with linux, its because they
              don't respect you.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            With this idea in mind, what is the most convenient and easiest
            way to return to normalcy? This is where Mint comes into play.
            Mint is the most popularly used "Linux" distribution widely used
            today for many good reasons. Its open source, adheres to unix
            philosophy, and naturally is easy to use out of the box. This
            makes it a great choice, not only is it for refugees running away
            from the abusive Windows OS, but its also great for long time
            veterans who have been using Linux for quite some time.
          </p>

          <h4>Distro hopping is for the un-serious</h4>
          <p>
            On the internet, when looking up "linux", you will find many
            varieties. All of them have an "associated user identiy". This is
            a trap, don't fall for it. Sure its fun in the beginning to
            associate with your "clan" of linux lets say, but its all just an
            entry point in the end of the day. Its all modular, if you don't
            like say the initial init system or any other part of the software
            of your OS of chooing, you can just change it. This is linux,
            litterally anything and everything you can
            configure/change/delete/install, it doesn't matter. There is a
            really rediculous "flexing" culture that you will find, well
            perhaps everywhere, but it really exposes itself quite often in
            software. This mindset has done great reputational damage to many
            underated software technologies because of ego, don't be that
            person. The mission is to improve the world not put others down.

          <h4>How could you install Mint?</h4>
          <p>
            If I'm being honest, there are a lot of really great guides and
            resources out on the internet. I could make a guide, but quite
            honestly, the official Mint website has a great guide. If your
            lazy like myself, there are a ton of great youtube videos and
            guides online, personally I recommend "Mental Outlaw" linux mint
            install videos because he's a chill guy but there are also plenty
            others. If I were to make a guide only like maybe three people
            would see it anyways, and I probably can't do better than what's
            out there anyways.
