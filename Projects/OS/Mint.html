          <h1>Mint OS, a basic overview.</h1>
          <section>
            <h4>Why even bother?</h4>
            <p>
              In today's world, when you say, pick a random desktop computer
              typically you'll find that it's operating with Windows. Despite
              Windows being a popular desktop OS, it has greatly deviated from
              the standard. Just because something is popular, doesn't make it
              the correct method nor the standard. I am going to assume I don't
              need to explain too much here considering its kind of obvious to
              most people that "modern" popular software just isn't what it used
              to be. This is where Linux comes into play, not only does it give
              you control over your computer or "machine", but you can make your
              experience with technology in general so much more pleasant. There
              is a misconception that "linux is difficult", to this I say
              remember when you first learned to walk or ride a bike. Your used
              to the easy training wheels, they make you feel safe. This general
              idea applies the same way throughout life, anything you may not be
              used to is always intimidating of course.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this idea in mind, what is the most convenient and easiest
              way to return to normalcy? This is where Mint comes into play.
              Mint is the most popularly used "Linux" distribution widely used
              today for many good reasons. Its open source, adheres to unix
              philosophy, and naturally is easy to use out of the box. This
              makes it a great choice. Not only is it for refugees running away
              from the abusive Windows OS, but its also great for long time
              veterans who have been using Linux for quite some time.
            </p>

            <h4>There is no rush.</h4>
            <p>
              Perhaps most people don't have this problem, so I'll say it for
              myself at the very least. Its cool to get excited about
              something... cool! But, you need to be careful not to get yourself
              in a difficult spot. Quite often I'll see something shiny that I
              want to tinker with, and immediatly just start configuring it.
              This could be bad if say you have job that is dependent on your
              reliable workflow. If your seriously looking at linux, I would
              advise to consider all the changes that you may need to make. Does
              your same editor for writing code work? Can any software projects
              you may be building transition nicely? Do all your general
              tools/applications transfer over? Generally speaking the answer
              will be yes, because actually a lot of cross compatibility efforts
              have been made over the years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lets pretend for a moment Intellij doesn't have a linux download
              (it does). I want to use this example because its the "recommended
              editor" for my Java class at my school and lately people have
              taken interest in me using Neovim. Sometimes, whatever tools your
              used to using, maybe like microsoft office, aren't available or
              easily setup. In these moments its important to recognize and
              accept the alternatives, in this case, our pretend situation, that
              is Neovim. Keep in mind, It could take a weekend to a week of
              setting up Neovim to intuitivly understand whats going on and to
              get it working for yourself, so I'm using an extreme example here.
              At first your overwhelmed, but if you have the courage to pull
              through, commonly you'll actually have an even better setup than
              what you are used to. This process will force you to learn your
              tools, which in turn will make you a better user of whatever said
              tool.
            </p>
            <p>
              The proper strategy to do here, is to test drive. Find some
              un-used laptop, or even just get this running in a virtual machine
              just to get the feel for it. Try to go say an hour of using your
              new linux machine, something doesn't work? Hey you still have your
              old Windows computer to fall back on if your getting stressed out.
              Then try a day, a week, and so on.

            <h2>Don't turn linux into your identity</h2>
            <p>
              On the internet, when looking up "linux", you will find many
              varieties. All of them have an "associated user identiy". This is
              a trap, don't fall for it. Sure its fun in the beginning to
              associate with your "clan" of linux lets say, but its all just an
              entry point in the end of the day. Its all modular, if you don't
              like say the initial init system or any other part of the software
              of your OS of chooing, you can just change it. This is linux,
              litterally anything and everything you can
              configure/change/delete/install, it doesn't matter. There is a
              really rediculous "flexing" culture that you will find, well
              perhaps everywhere, but it really exposes itself quite often in
              software. This mindset has done great reputational damage to many
              under-rated software technologies because of ego, don't be that
              person. The mission is to improve the world not put others down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two quotes I will use for this next part.
              <b>"There is always a bigger fish"</b> from Qui-Gon Jinn, and
              <b>"Comparison is the thief of joy"</b> from Theodore Roosevelt.
              If you understand these concepts you can just skip the rest of
              this paragraph, its okay, I'm also lazy and would do the same. If
              you don't adhere to this mindset, you will have an unhealthy
              purpose which will just blow up in your face eventually. In this
              case we are talking about linux, but its really not just linux at
              all as "linux" is just a kernel, traditionally its packaged with
              GNU utilities. However there are also Plan9 utilities from... well
              the Plan9 operating system. And so here we come upon our first
              comparison wall. You discover that there are other operating
              systems other than Windows, Mac, and Linux. Now you've heard me
              mention Plan9, and here's one more ecosystem, BSD which is where
              apple basically got all their technology from and just sold it
              under a proprietory license. People who use Plan9 or BSD might
              look down upon Linux users because XYZ. But guess what, there was
              once a man named Terry Davis who made his own Operating system
              known as TempleOS made with his own programming language HolyC,
              made with his own compiler, made with his own pretty much
              everything. But guess what, before Unix existed, you had to make
              your own operating system for each specific computer. Meaning
              there could be some un-known mad man who made the "ideal system".
              BUT GUESS WHAT, the plot thickens, computers being so new to our
              history, means that the perfect individual that could have
              possibly ever existed, may have very well died in the medieval
              period because he simply didn't have access to modern technology.
              A lot of people seem to think technology has been "exponentially"
              growing in the past century or so, and sure to an extent it has.
              However, accepting this idea without context, does a great
              dis-service to all the mathematicians throughout history, who have
              pioneered once "un-usable" concepts.

            <h4>How could you install Mint?</h4>
            <p>
              If I'm being honest, there are a lot of really great guides and
              resources out on the internet. I could make a guide, but quite
              honestly, the official Mint website has a great guide. If your
              lazy like myself, there are a ton of great youtube videos and
              guides online, personally I recommend "Mental Outlaw" linux mint
              install videos because he's a chill guy but there are also plenty
              others. If I were to make a guide only like maybe three people
              would see it anyways, and I probably can't do better than what's
              out there anyways.
