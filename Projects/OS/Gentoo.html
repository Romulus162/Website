          <h1>Why I like Gentoo.</h1>
          <p>
            In the beginning I started using Gentoo more as a joke, and then
            somewhere along the line it stopped being a joke.

          <h3>What makes Gentoo different than most linux distros?</h3>
          <p>
            Gentoo is a linux distribution where its flagship feature is that
            everything is compiled from source. This essentially means that
            rather than downloading pre-compiled binaries from any given
            repository, your cpu is... well from source, compiling all the
            code specifically to your hardware, rather than a more universal
            binary download. For some this is enough to turn them away from
            Gentoo as it would turn say a 2 minuet install process of any
            given software, to perhaps a multi-hour install depending on your
            allocated cpu threads. However most notably if you ever decide to
            seriously try out Gentoo, you'll have to compile the whole
            Operating system which generally speaking will take multiple
            hours, so be ready to just start the compile process before bed or
            your workday.

            Some people will call me crazy, but this is actually why I like
            Gentoo, its really great for learning. With the power of such
            detailed control, you can actually understand your machine much
            better, and even make it more secure/efficient. Let me just give a
            very basic example, my Gentoo system on my laptop is a X86-64
            architecture cpu, so I can just refuse all incoming code related
            to ARM64 through the kernel. Vise-versa on my GenPi4B, I can just
            turn off all X86-64 related incoming code during the compile
            process. This is really great not only for "efficiency", but more
            importantly security, as I remove dead code that would never be
            used anyways on my computer. Furthermore learning the Useflags
            feature is also great for understanding any new software you may
            be interested in downloading. Reading default useflags you'll find
            the features you would "expect" from your software, but commonly
            you'll find features maybe you'd like to add. When I was
            configuring my NAS system on my GenPi, I remember I had to
            recompile my graphical file manager with the samba flag in order
            to enable a "simple" drag and drop of files from one computer to
            another across my network. Typically this may be automatically
            enabled, on my Mint machine, the default file manager is Nemo, and
            this is automatically enabled. Sure it was very convenient,
            however Gentoo forcing me to enable this on my own, forced me to
            further understand and learn how my NAS system worked across my
            network, and I'm really grateful for that.

          <h3>Why you should try out Gentoo, and how to go about it.</h3>
          <p>
            Gentoo as stated earlier is actually really great for learning not
            just linux at a fast rate, but also just how your overall machine
            operates. However with such amazing benefits, comes great cost. It
            will be very frusturating at times and probably overwhelming. When
            I finally got my first Gentoo system up and running, it had taken
            me roughly three weeks of just restarting the whole install
            process after I would accidentally lock myself out somehow, or
            just completely break something. Granted the three weeks is a
            little inflated because I would just abandon all hope for a few
            days at times and then try again later. So obviously if you decide
            to use Gentoo, you should start off on say a secondary computer
            like a laptop, maybe a virtual machine. Something that won't
            interupt your daily workflow, because Gentoo in best case scenario
            WILL interupt your daily activities by simple nature of how it
            works. So, you want to be in a position to just walk away at any
            given moment and return later.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've mentioned this quite a few times already, but Gentoo is
            really great for learning linux and computers in general. I've
            used Mint for a pretty long time, this isn't a complaint but an
            observation. Mint is so user friendly, that I never really had to
            dig deep or work hard to get anything setup or working properly.
            However with Gentoo it has forced me to understand everything
            because simply it wouldn't work otherwise. As soon as I started
            using Gentoo, honestly, ever since I've had a revolutionary boom
            in not just learning, but perhaps even lifestyle. Struggle is a
            beautiful action to be honest.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Ok Admittedly maybe Gentoo isn't for everyone.</h3>
          <p>
            So this goes without saying but you do need to have a lot of
            patience when dealing with this distribution. That's ok, if Gentoo
            isn't for you that's totally fine. I mentioned this on my Mint
            page, but honestly most of what you can do in one distribution of
            linux, quite honestly you can do the same in any other. I say
            most, because I'm not sure you can really configure the kernel
            itself quite so easily as you can with Gentoo. But that's not a
            problem actually! If you really care for that level of
            configuration to your kernel but don't quite want to install a
            full blown Gentoo system, you can just install a Gentoo kernel and
            have the rest of your operating system be Mint for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point I'll have a walkthrough of installing Gentoo on what
            will be my third Gentoo machine. This will be related to my
            Libreboot project on my T420 Thinkpad. I mention this because even
            though Gentoo can come off as "too much". Seeing the process and
            semi-understanding what's going on alone, can stil be a great
            learning experience.
