            <h1>Bevy Engine, and its ecosystem.</h1>
            <p>
              Initially this will be an "article/blog" of sorts. However in the
              near future, I would like to showcase some guides/examples on how
              you could get some basic tools and maybe a basic project going.

            <h3>Todays popular game engines.</h3>
            <p>
              Today if you are interested in game developoment, and your new to
              the field, typically you'll find yourself with two maybe three
              "popular options". For indie development, you will be drowned out
              by everyone talking about popular options such as Unity, Unreal,
              and maybe the accepted Godot option. To be quite blunt, I'm going
              to talk about why I dislike these options and it will probably
              come off as rude if you've invested a lot of effort into learning
              these tools, so understand that is not the intention. This will
              make more sense when I talk about why I like Bevy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, I do not like Unity nor Unreal. They have both
              traumatised me from both the developer side and gamer side of
              things. None of the developer skills marketed as "easy" translate
              outside of Unity or Unreal. Granted I don't have much time
              invested into these engines, but frankely, as soon as I saw all
              the walls of UI buttons, it quickly became overwhelming and
              boring. Game development is a form of expression/art, and if your
              not having fun during the process, what are you doing. Granted if
              it actually works for you, and you enjoy it, I'm not here to tell
              you how to live your life. Yet this isn't exactly an uncommon
              story, Blender is a very popular tool for 3D projects, try
              learning that as a beginner and again you'll become very
              overwhelmed. This has lead a lot of artists to alternatives that
              are simply easier to navigate.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't know about Unreal, but Unity is a very suspicious software
              and I do not trust it at all. I had an experience during my
              installation and un-install and I refuse to ever try it again.
            </p>

              >
              <br />
              From the gamer perspective, I have become very frusturated with
              games made from Unity and Unreal. I don't really play video games
              that much anymore for plently of reasons, one of which being I
              genuienly dislike modern games. I don't mean just the "Triple A"
              games, but also the indie ones, so many just put very little
              effort into optimization or just genuine creativity. I blame a lot
              of this on Unity and Unreal, for making the game-development
              process "simple". You've sacrificed the soul of your game, for a
              simple cheap "solution". Quite commonly whenever I express how a
              game is terribly made, a very cringe argument "get a better
              computer" comes up. Despite what many may think, a hardware
              solution is NOT a solution to a software problem. Expecting your
              users to have "good hardware" shows incompetence.

            <h3>What is Bevy?</h3>
            <p>
              So what are you to do? You could make your own game engine which
              many do and its very commendable. However not everyone has the
              time or maybe even know-how to do such a project. The next best
              thing you can do is use someone else's game engine project. That's
              what Bevy is. Bevy is a second iteration of a game engine written
              in Rust, initially it was called Amethyst engine, however it was
              becoming difficult to maintain/build. So the developers scrapped
              Amethyst took the lessons they learned from there and applied it
              to Bevy. This was a good and healthy process because now Bevy
              every year is becoming so much more powerful, and you don't have
              to go through it!
            </p>
            <p>
              Bevy is open-source, so lets say you don't like some parts of the
              engine, or you want to add something. Hey awesome that's really
              easy to do just fork the repository and bam you have full control
              of everything. Additionally, because of the fact its open-source
              and designed to be very modular, you actually have a LOT of
              options. For example Bevy is an engine, but intentially, lets say,
              minimal. It doesn't come with its own physics engine or graphical
              user interface. This could be alarming for some, but its actually
              exactly what you want. In the community the popular physics
              engines you can use for bevy are Rapier, Avian, and I think one
              named Thunderbolt? Want a nice dialogue system? A popular
              community choice is a crate (library/package/repository) called
              yarn-spinner. Do you actually want/need a UI for de-bugging or
              development, hey you can actually get one going really quickly
              with bevy-inspector-egui crate. That's why bevy itself although
              being a simple "game-engine", is really more of a community driven
              ecosystem, where so many people help each other out and build out
              various solutions tailored for the developer, by developers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another such area, in Bevy the system for building UI is
              litterally imitating HTML and CSS practice. Yes its not exactly
              and litterally HTML/CSS, but it imitates it as best it can within
              Rust, and that's why using Bevy is such a breath of fresh air.
              Maybe you already understand HTML and CSS ok great then building
              UI for your game in Bevy will actually not be so difficult for you
              to pickup. It's the fact that Bevy follows the "Standard practice"
              which is what makes it so great.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally Bevy is a ECS or Entity Component System and is written in
              rust. This means that structurally, its forcing you to make a much
              more efficient project than traditional Object Orientated
              Programming structures such as Unity use. This means that even if
              you aren't the best say programmer, Bevy is already helping you
              make a better project just by how it works, and the rust compiler
              a very powerful and sophisticated tool, is very pro-active in
              helping you out.
