          <h1>Bevy Engine, and its ecosystem. (Revised)</h1>
          <p>
            Initially this will be an "article/blog" of sorts. However in the
            near future, I would like to showcase some guides/examples on how
            you could get some basic tools and maybe a basic project going.
          </p>

          <h3>temporary recent context of this page</h3>
          <p>
            for recent context, the first iteration of this page, after
            revising made me come off as bitter towards Unity specifically,
            but the overall modern game industry as a whole. This broke not
            only professionalism, but also the spirit of creating and
            learning. With that in mind I've re-written this page. Most of
            what exists on this website has the purpose of "existing" for the
            sake of me building a nice flow and user experience which is
            currently lacking. In the coming development phases, there will be
            less writing, and more "UI/UX".

          <h3>What is Bevy?</h3>
          <p>
            Bevy is an ECS driven game engine written in Rust. This
            essentially means its a very modern new game engine that just
            recently turned 5 years old. However its technically a little
            older than that since it is actually a second attempt from the
            same authors of the Amethyst game engine. Amethyst as it became
            larger, was difficult to maintain and work with, so the efforts
            were canabalized and started anew into the Bevy project.
          </p>
          <section>
            <h4>Why is ECS nice?</h4>
            <p>
              ECS stands for Entity Component System. It has the result of
              being far more efficient than Object Orientated Programming or
              OOP. Although, most game genre's won't exactly notice the
              performance difference, especially if you are in a small indie
              game environment. However, one game genre that could actually
              greatly benefit from this is the timeless RTS genre. In classic
              RTS games, one of the most powerful strategies is "more beats
              less", where say one opponent could have better quality units,
              whilest the other just simply has more "cheaper" units.
              Typically more beats less. That means a LOT of entities within a
              given game, and as you scale up the entities, the worse the
              performance can become. For most indie developers, a RTS genre
              is just too much to take on as it would require quite a bit of
              UI, and classical AI implementations just to get something
              "acceptable" and so its never really considered for small teams.
              I have a little bit of bias, because Bevy was essentially my
              first "serious" game engine that I learned game development on
              and still do to this day. So with that in mind, in my opinion
              structurally speaking, ECS just seems simpler to work with and
              that's why I like it.

            <h4>Bevy philosophy</h4>
            <p>
              Bevy itself, if you coming from a more built out game engine
              like say Unity or Unreal, can appear VERY minimal. What I mean
              by this is well, you kind of have to setup a lot of the tools
              yourself, but don't be dis-heartened a lot of the community has
              working solutions you can easily just import. So for example, to
              install Bevy, you actually have to install it via the terminal
              using Rusts package manager cargo. Already that gives a clue as
              to how Bevy works, everything you want to do in Bevy, you need
              to do via the terminal. Obviously you'd want to have a dedicated
              IDE of sorts, doing EVERYTHING from the command line although
              possible, can become rediculous pretty quickly. From here, to
              run Bevy you would have to essentially setup your main function
              to even call a window the proper way, in order to even get a
              visual window of your first project. This means if your
              expecting some already setup tooling like a developer UI space
              your not going to get that unless you set it up yourself. This
              may seem as overwhelming, but actually it means your game engine
              is going to evolve to your project and not your project to the
              game engine. However some development tools don't need to be
              exactly "unique". Commonly, as your project gets bigger, it
              actually becomes more convenient to have a developer UI of sorts
              for debugging and/or an editor tool of sorts. In such
              situations, the bevy community has lots of packages already made
              for common requirements such as this. The community standard
              solution in this scenario is bevy-inspector-egui, where in a few
              short steps you could have a "Unity-Like" developer
              interface/UI. As it turns out most people do like to have a
              developer UI of sorts, so eventually it seems Bevy will have an
              official built-in solution, and actually they have publicly
              stated they would base it off bevy-inspector-egui, whether it
              gets incorporated or heavily inspired I don't know, but
              currently its the unofficial official solution that even the
              developers of Bevy recommend. This works because in the end of
              the day, Bevy is open-source.
