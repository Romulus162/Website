            <p>
              This website is relatively new and I only spend like maybe 4-5
              hours on it a week. It will improve with time.
            </p>
            <p>Simple tends to be better.</p>

            <h3>
              Very under-developed website, below you'll find what "exists" so
              far
            </h3>
            <p>
              For the moment I'm just getting stuff to "exist" first, and then
              I'll make stuff look nice or just delete what doesn't make sense.
              For example, this landing page is only temporarily going to have
              this table below, and not every page will exist in the future.
              I've also deleted my "interests" pages because well, I don't think
              it makes sense to express that if I'm being honest. Of course its
              nice to have some "fun" or "interesting" things. However at the
              same time, I don't really like to engage in "social media" as its
              just really boring, and that's what it was turning into.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not every single one of these pages will be a "blog" format,
              currently thats all that really exists, since they are the easiest
              to "populate". However examples like the programming pages, I
              would be learning X86 and ARM languages, and would kind of like to
              have those pages be more like a "guide", as I learn it myself
              along the way.
